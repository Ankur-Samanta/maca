[{"question": "If $A$ and $B$ are vertices of a polyhedron, define the distance $d(A,B)$ to be the minimum number of edges of the polyhedron one must traverse in order to connect $A$ and $B$. For example, if $\\overline{AB}$ is an edge of the polyhedron, then $d(A, B) = 1$, but if $\\overline{AC}$ and $\\overline{CB}$ are edges and $\\overline{AB}$ is not an edge, then $d(A, B) = 2$. Let $Q$, $R$, and $S$ be randomly chosen distinct vertices of a regular icosahedron (regular polyhedron made up of 20 equilateral triangles). Find the probability that $d(Q, R) > d(R, S)$. The final answer can be written in the form $\\frac{m}{n}$, where $m$ and $n$ are relatively prime positive integers.
